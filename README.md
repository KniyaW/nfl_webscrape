### About Me
I am a Senior at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) pursuing a bachelors of science in data science, with minor areas in computer science, economics, & mathematics. Over my academic career at Marquette I have learned how to use many coding languages such as Python, Java, R, SQL, and more all to help me further my understanding of computational analysis. This repo, along with my others, are simply to showcase my projects and other fun activities that exemplify the ucurrent nderstanding that I have in the data science field.
